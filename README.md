# codeAlpha_image_to_sound
# Image to Sound Converter

A simple script that utilizes Python libraries like PIL (Python Imaging Library), Tesseract (for OCR), and gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech) to convert text from an image to an audio file.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the script.
2. Install the required dependencies using pip:

pip install pillow pytesseract gTTS

3. Update the path to the Tesseract executable in the script if necessary.

## Usage

1. Place the image file with the text to be converted in the same directory as the script.
2. Update the `image_path` variable in the script with the appropriate image file name.
3. Run the script using the following command:

python script_name.py

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- PIL (Python Imaging Library)
- Tesseract OCR
- gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech)

## Note

Make sure that the Tesseract executable path is correctly specified in the script. This script assumes that the Tesseract OCR tool is installed on your system.
